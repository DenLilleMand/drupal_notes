The plan is to subtheme bootstrap on a drupal 8 installation with drush .

So obviously we need to have drush 8 installed first, i think i got it installed somewhere 
so i wont go through that...https://www.drupal.org/node/2603018 


Drush docs: http://www.drush.org/en/master/   eller bare "drush help"


Først skal vi dl bootstrap theme:

drush dl bootstrap

Så lav et nyt theme,
og det theme skal så bare extende bootstrap i sin <themename>.info.yml fil 
med den property der hedder 'base theme'
